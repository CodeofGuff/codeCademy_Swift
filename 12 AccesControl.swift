// Access Control - Makes code safer and robust
// allows us to control access to properties and methos within our code
// by implementing different levels of access on properties and methods, 
// we determine which other parts of the code can read their values, write to them, and execute their methods








// REVIEW
// The boundaries for access control are modules, source files, and structs.
// Public is the most permissive and allows access between modules. (useful for SDKs and frameworks)
// Internal is the default level and allows access anywhere within a module.
// File private allows access within a source file.
// Private can only be used within the scope of a struct. (least permissive)
// Private properties are defined using the private syntax.
// Memberwise initializers can’t access private properties, so you need to use default values, make them optional, or use the init method.
// Private methods use the same syntax as private properties and can only be called within the scope of the struct that defines them.
// Computed properties aren’t stored values, rather they are derived from other stored properties.
// Can be read-only. (only have getter method)
// Can set them, in which case you change the underlying properties from which they are derived.
// Property observers are built in methods that get called when properties are set.
// didSet gives us the old value.
// willSet gives us the new value.
// Properties can have a more restricted access level to set vs. get.
// Type properties are defined independently from any particular instance of a structure.
